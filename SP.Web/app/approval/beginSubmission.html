            <h1>Begin Registration</h1>
            <h4>
                Thank you for your interest
            </h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Before commencing please note</strong> that the registration process involves 3 steps, entering (in turn) details of:
                <ol>
                    <li>Your Institution <aside><em>If your institution is already registered</em>, please contact the institution administrator
                        to register your department for you, rather than proceeding with this registration process.</aside>
                    </li>
                    <li>Your Department</li>
                    <li>Yourself</li>
                </ol>
            </p>
            <p>
                The process of registering will take about 10 minutes, and it is somewhat easier to complete the 3 steps in 1 sitting. 
                If you are interrupted, click <span class="btn btn-sm btn-success disabled">Save &amp; continue <i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i></span> 
                <small class="small">
                    (and fix any errors)
                </small>, 
                copy or bookmark the address (which contains a unique code for the data you have entered) and come back to that page when you have time. If you have not
                completed the 3 steps within 7 days of commencing, any details you have entered will be automatically deleted. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Subsequent to completing the registration process, the website administrators will be notified of your submission, 
                and you will need to wait for approval before you may log in to the application 
                (you will receive an email notifying you that you appplication has been approved). 
                If the details submitted are from a bone-fide medical or resuscitation simulation programme
                <small class="small">(as opposed to spam)</small>, you will be approved.
