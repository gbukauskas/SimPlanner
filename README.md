# SimPlanner
####Medical Simulation Course Planning, Participant Confirmation and Reporting
A web based application to coordinate running a hospital simulation program - development phase
uses BreezeJs & Angular, based on John Papa's Hot-Towel template

##About
Simulation Planner is a tool originally designed by and for the Starship Hospital Simulation Program to simplify
organising medical simulation courses and keeping track of institution wide data, including:
* Faculty and participants attending a course
  * (including auto-notification and tracking reply confirmation by email ± text message)
* Developing course timetables
* Which scenarios are to be run during a course 
  * And checking which scenarios participants have previously completed, to avoid repeating scenarios
* Faculty member roles - including lectures, activities and scenario roles (e.g. debriefing, sim director)
* Producing annual reports of simulation activity, as a whole institution and by department
* Track total hours simulation time (and thereby lifespan) for each manequin, including hours spent away for service and service costs

**It is free to use for institutions such as hospitals and universities** (a small fee may be charged per text messaging reminder if you choose to use the text messaging service)

###Desired Features
- [ ] Courses with 'faculty present throughout' & 'faculty only present for slots listed'. I guess being a course organiser in the latter would mean he/she present throughout - perhaps 'visitor checkbox'
- [ ] Department/Institution Reports
- [ ] multi-stream courses with faculty/participants split into different rooms (tabbed on course roles form)
- [ ] discuss with potential users re ways of splitting eg red/blue groups & ways of presenting in workable UI
- [ ] Allow manequin & room booking without specific course
